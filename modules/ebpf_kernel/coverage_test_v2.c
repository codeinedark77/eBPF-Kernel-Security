/*
 * coverage_test_v2.c - does the REAL DriftNet probe hooks actually see these?
 *
 * Supersedes the coverage_gaps.c from earlier in this conversation. That one guessed
 * at raw __arm64_sys_* syscall hooks (openat/connect/execve), matching the README's
 * diagram. The real bpf_probe.c hooks two different things instead:
 *   - kprobe/security_socket_connect  (an LSM hook, specific to the connect() path)
 *   - kprobe/do_execve_file           (an internal exec-handling function)
 * openat monitoring is fully disabled in the shipped code (its own comment says it
 * caused kernel panics on CRDroid) -- there's nothing live to test there, so this
 * drops the openat2 check entirely rather than probing a feature that doesn't exist.
 *
 * Also worth knowing before you run this: NEITHER live probe has the "skip uid <
 * 10000" filter you might expect from the whitepaper -- that filter only ever
 * existed inside the disabled openat block. The two probes that actually run watch
 * every UID, system daemons included. So this test doesn't need root or a special
 * UID to be SEEN; you only need root to read the dashboard/logs afterward and
 * confirm what showed up.
 *
 * Three checks, each printed with a unique COVTEST_ marker to grep for on the
 * driftnetd side afterward:
 *
 *   1. connect() on a plain TCP socket       -> SHOULD be caught (this is exactly
 *                                               the path security_socket_connect
 *                                               sits on)
 *   2. sendto() on an UNCONNECTED UDP socket -> the actual gap under test: this
 *                                               never calls connect(), so it should
 *                                               NOT traverse security_socket_connect
 *                                               at all if the hook is doing what its
 *                                               name implies
 *   3. execveat() instead of execve()        -> genuinely unknown without testing --
 *                                               do_execve_file may or may not be a
 *                                               shared choke point for both on this
 *                                               specific kernel/vendor fork
 *
 * Build (from wherever you already build anti_debug_arm64 / vulkan_engine_arm64--
 * same NDK toolchain):
 *   aarch64-linux-android30-clang -O2 -Wall -o coverage_test_v2 coverage_test_v2.c
 * Push and run (no root needed to GENERATE the traffic, only to read results after):
 *   adb push coverage_test_v2 /data/local/tmp/
 *   adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/coverage_test_v2
 *   adb shell /data/local/tmp/coverage_test_v2
 * Then, as root: grep driftnetd's stdout/log and the dashboard for "covtest".
 *
 * Both network targets below are Cloudflare's well-known public services (1.1.1.1),
 * chosen specifically because they're harmless, fast, and not going to look like
 * real exfiltration to anyone watching -- don't swap in anything else here.
